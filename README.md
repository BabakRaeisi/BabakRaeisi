ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Babak â€” a software engineer with a versatile background in game development and 3D art, now fully focused on backend development, Cloud Computing, and DevOps.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on building real-world projects using .NET, SQL, and microservices, with an emphasis on cloud infrastructure (AWS), CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Terraform). I'm also exploring IoT and cybersecurity as part of my long-term learning path.

In a previous chapter, I specialized in game development with Unity and earned certification as a 3D artist, showcasing strong visual and technical skills. Now, I combine that creative mindset with robust software engineering practices.

ðŸ”§ I enjoy solving real problems, building clean and scalable systems, and collaborating with teams to deliver high-impact results.
