ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Babak â€” a software engineer with a versatile background in game development, now fully focused on backend development and Cloud Computing 
Currently, Iâ€™m working on building real-world projects using .NET, SQL, and microservices, with an emphasis on cloud infrastructure (AWS, azure), CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Terraform).
