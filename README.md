Hey, Iâ€™m Babakâ€”a skilled software engineer and game developer with a strong passion for Cloud Computing, DevOps, and IoT, which Iâ€™m actively diving into. Beyond coding, Iâ€™m also a certified 3D artist for video games, with a sharp eye for detail and a love for modeling.

I thrive in programming, SDLC, and teamwork, bringing solid problem-solving skills to the table. Whether itâ€™s writing clean code, optimizing workflows, or collaborating on projects, Iâ€™m all about delivering high-quality results.
