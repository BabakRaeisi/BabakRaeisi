ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Babak â€” a software engineer with a versatile background in game development, now fully focused on backend development, Cloud Computing, and DevOps.
Currently, Iâ€™m working on building real-world projects using .NET, SQL, and microservices, with an emphasis on cloud infrastructure (AWS), CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Terraform).

ðŸ”§ I enjoy solving real problems, building clean and scalable systems, and collaborating with teams to deliver high-impact results.
